## Deconstructing the AI Agent: My Journey with Atlas

I wanted to understand how tools like Cursor and Claude Code actually work under the hood—so I decided to build one myself.

Atlas is a lightweight, agentic code editor built in Python. Instead of using pre-made frameworks that hide the complexity, I built this agent from the ground up using the Google Gemini API.

The project explores the critical transition from "Chatbot" to "Agent":

  1. Giving the model tools (Function Calling).

  2. Allowing it to execute code.

  3. Creating a Feedback Loop where the agent can catch its own bugs and fix them in real-time.

Current State: The project currently explores the critical transition from "Chatbot" to "Agent" via function calling and error-correction loops.

### What's Next?
This is just the beginning. I am actively developing Atlas to deepen my understanding of agentic architectures. My roadmap includes implementing multi-file reasoning and persistent memory to create a truly autonomous developer experience. Additionally, I am expanding the project's scope to explore the intersection of AI agents and cybersecurity, investigating how autonomous agents can assist in security auditing and vulnerability detection.
